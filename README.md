# Telco-Customer-Churn-Analysis
In my role as a data analyst, I embarked on a journey to uncover insights and understand the factors contributing to customer churn using Power BI. Armed with a dataset containing customer information and churn status, I employed various analytical techniques and visualization tools within Power BI to gain valuable insights and identify potential causes of customer churn.

### Data Exploration:
The first step was to explore the dataset and understand its structure. I assessed the different variables, such as customer demographics, services subscribed to, contract details, payment methods, and more. This helped me form a comprehensive understanding of the available data and set the stage for subsequent analysis.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation:
To ensure accurate analysis, I performed data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming variables into suitable formats. By leveraging Power BI's data transformation capabilities, I prepared the dataset for meaningful analysis and interpretation.

### Descriptive Analytics:
Using Power BI's visualization tools, I conducted descriptive analytics to gain a holistic overview of the customer churn situation. I generated charts, graphs, and summary statistics to examine key metrics such as churn rate, distribution of churn across various variables, and customer tenure.

### Segmentation and Comparison:
To dig deeper, I leveraged Power BI's capabilities to segment the customer base and compare churn rates across different customer groups. I sliced the data based on variables like gender, marital status, payment method and phone service. This enabled me to identify patterns and variations in churn rates among these segments.

### Correlation and Trend Analysis:
Employing Power BI's analytical functions, I explored relationships between variables and churn. I examined correlations between churn and factors like service usage, contract length, and payment method.


### Insights and Recommendations:
Through my analysis in Power BI, I uncovered valuable insights into the factors driving customer churn. For example, I found that customers on month-to-month contracts and those using certain payment methods exhibited higher churn rates. Armed with these insights, I recommended several strategies to address churn, including offering incentives for longer contracts, enhancing communication, and promoting alternative payment methods.
